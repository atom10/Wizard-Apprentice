"Oh, thank you, my lady! Were it not for your assistance, I would endure a thrashing until the morn."#changeSpeakerName-Villager
The relieved peasant expressed, a mix of gratitude and sheer relief evident on her weathered face. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"No need for such thanks. Merely tend to those geese for now."
I replied, my words carrying the practical essence of a village where simplicity and shared responsibilities were the norm.
