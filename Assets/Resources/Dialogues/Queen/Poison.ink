"After our conversation, it took me considerable effort to face you again."
"But, as you already know, I am in distress, and I believe you could offer solace."
Queen shared, her regal demeanor softened by a touch of vulnerability. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"What do you need me to do?"
I asked, standing in the presence of her throne.
"As an apprentice to a wizard, you possess knowledge about potions. Do you know anything about poisons?" #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She inquired, her voice lowered to a confidential tone. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I do. I studied them since I was 10."
I disclosed, the weight of secrecy settling between us.
"Perfect. Then let me share my plan with you. Please, bear with me. I want to poison my husband." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She confided, the last sentence whispered in hushed tones that resonated through the royal chamber. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"You want to end your husband's life?"
I responded in my usual straightforward manner, the nuances of her revelation lost on me.
"Idiot!" #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She exclaimed, casting a wary glance around before taking a composed breath. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I need you to be discreet. This matter is no jest. My husband is a powerful wizard, and I've long desired to be free of him." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
"I cannot resort to conventional poison, for arsenic would be too easily traceable. I have only one chance."
"My master is also a powerful wizard. Perhaps you should seek his counsel?" #changeSpeakerName-Freya
I suggested, unaware of the delicate balance between loyalty and newfound confidences.
"You cannot tell him about this! I do not trust him, and if you betray me, I will see you hanged." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
Suiko warned, her eyes reflecting the desperation of her plea. #changeSpeakerName-Freya #option-0-requiresRelation-Queen-100 #option-0-changesInkFile-Dialogues/Queen/PoisonFinished #option-0-addGatherQuest-GatherQuests/Poison #option-1-forceCloseDialogue #option-0-advanceTime-4 #option-0-requiresTime-betweenHours-20-24 #option-0-addJournalEntry-Plot/queen/potionOfDeath

=== mission ===
 What do you expect to happen afterward?"
 I questioned, delving into the complexities of her plan.
"I will find a way to introduce the poison into his wine when he least suspects it. I know him well enough. I've waited for far too long." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
Suiko declared, her determination cutting through the air. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"What about the kingdom? Do you know how to rule by yourself?"
I pressed, emphasizing the broader consequences of her actions.
"It's not important." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She dismissed, her focus fixed on the singular goal of liberation. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"It is, as your kingdom is your responsibility as a queen."
I asserted, intertwining the threads of duty with the weight of her personal vendetta.
"I do not particularly care. If you wish, you can become a part of the royal court, but you must help me." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She proposed, attempting to enlist my aid with the promise of power. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I will not be swayed by the allure of potential influence. I want you to promise that you will take care of your people." 
I insisted, grounding the conversation in the principles of leadership.
"And you will believe I will do so just because I said it?" #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She challenged, skepticism lacing her words. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"Yes, because a royal's word is sacred." 
I replied, embracing the ideals of honor and responsibility. #changeSpeakerName-Queen
She chuckled. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I believe you to be naive, but if you truly have that one expectation, then I shall commit to it." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
"I will take my leave now. I will bring you that potion." #changeSpeakerName-Freya
I declared, preparing to embark on a journey that blurred the lines between loyalty and moral quandaries.
"Au revoir, grim reaper." #changeSpeakerName-Queen
Suiko bid farewell, her words echoing in the regal chamber as the weight of a kingdom's fate hung in the balance. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
