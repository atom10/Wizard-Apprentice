It has been thirteen years since the day I was born. All those days meld into a singular viewâ€”a room steeped in books, weathered furniture, and an ancient dust hanging visibly in the air. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
The only variable in this constant environment is a man. I am acquainted with him, yet I do not truly know him. While he visits my room, he remains distant enough that his scent eludes me. 
He wears but one expression. He is the man who allows me to dwell within his tower. His name is Magnus.
"Greetings, Magnus."
"Freya." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
He gestured with an open palm, a sign of greeting. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"Congratulations on reaching the ripe age of thirteen. What do you wish for this year?" #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"I must say, one thought always lingers in my mind. I ponder the world beyond these brick walls. Is that world akin to the tales in the books you've bestowed upon me?  #changeSpeakerName-Freya
Do philosophers traverse village centers, enlightening the less fortunate with their wisdom? Are temples adorned with fresh flowers and devoted believers?"
He interrupted my unfolding thoughts.
"Do you wish to visit the outside?" #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"I do." #changeSpeakerName-Freya
An uncomfortable silence descended between us. We locked eyes, waiting for one of us to break it. Yet, neither dared to do so for a minute that felt like eternity.
"If that is your wish, then I hope your journey brings you joy. However, I do have one condition." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"Yes?" #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"You need to come back when the sun goes down. You are still a child under my care." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"I understand. Thank you, Magnus. I will begin my journey once I pack the most important goods."  #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I am going to give you two gifts. I trust they will help you." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
His hands emanated an orange fluorescent fog. It floated to another room, a place of knowlage and began expanding. A small explosion followed, revealing a large rodent. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
A capybara, a semi-aquatic guinea pig known for its social and gentle nature.
"This is Magibara, a magical familiar that will accompany you on your journey. It shall help with alchemy and be an emotional support." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"I want you to take this coat with you. It's not magical, yet the outer layer is a necessity" 
He handed me a deep blue coat. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"Thank you. I will take my leave then."
"Go back when it gets dark, Freya. I trust you shall not disappoint me." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus
"I promise." #changeSpeakerName-Freya
"I do have one mission for you." #changeSpeakerName-Magnus #option-0-changesInkFile-Dialogues/Magnus/Magnus_Mission_one #option-0-forceCloseDialogue
