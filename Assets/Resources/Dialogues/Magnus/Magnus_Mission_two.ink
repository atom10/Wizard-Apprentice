I responded, ready to embark on yet another quest within the enchanting confines of the tower. His request, though seemingly simple, held the promise of a culinary alchemy that transcended the mundane. #changeSpeakerName-Freya
With a wave of his hand, Magnus conjured a listing of components required for the soup. The aged paper spoke of culinary arts intertwined with the magical, an echo of medieval gastronomy steeped in mystery.
